# Image Upload 

A simple MERN  app where the users can upload images and can display them on the dom. 

We used the 'multer' middleware in the backend to handle the images.


## Facing Issue?

A major issue you can  encounter is on the server side, which is "database connection failed."


If that happens run the command,
```bash
  sudo systemctl start mongod 
 ```
 on Terminal.

To know the status 
```bash
sudo systemctl status mongod 
```
